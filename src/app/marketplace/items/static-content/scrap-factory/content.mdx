# Scrap Factory

Welcome to the exciting world of Scrap Factory, a custom game mode in Scrap Mechanic where you get to build your very own factory and become a tycoon! In this game mode, you'll start with just a few droppers and furnaces, but with hard work and determination, you'll be able to expand your factory and become a true master of the scrap industry.

Your goal in Scrap Factory is to create as many items as possible using the droppers and furnaces at your disposal.
